Time and Memory complexity analysis

-->Time complexity<--

* For constructing the binary tree total cost is numbers of nodes "n"
so overall time complexity O(n)

* For getting the paths to root node of two given nodes is equal to the numbers of 
nodes to the root, In worst case it will be height of the tree O(h)+O(h)

* and selecting least common node between two Stacks cost would be in worst case O(h), where
h height of the tree

-> Overall time complexity in worst case is O(n)

-->Space/Memory<--

* For constructing the binary tree total Space complexity in worst case in O(n)
where n is number of nodes of the tree
* and Space complexity of storing values to Stack is propotional to height of the tree 
in worst case so we can consider O(h)

-> Overall Space complexity of this problem is O(n)
